step[1] enter the class name
step[2] public static void (String args[])
step[3] System.out.println("Enter the number");
step[4] System.out.println(100);
step[5] System.out.print("the digit of the given number is:    ");
step[6] System.out.print(3);


[9]write a java program to print all the factor of the given number.

step[1] Enter the two numbers
step[2] if we enter the 1st number=i and second number =n
step[3] condition is that i>=n
step[4]	deviding to number =i/n
step[5] we will get factors of the given number.

[10]write a java program to find sum of the digits of the given number

step[1] Enter the number
step[2] if n>0
step[3]  n=234
step[4] digits=2+3+4
step[5]  sum=9

[11]write the java program to find the smallest of 3 numbers(a,b,c)

step[1] enter the number a,b,c
step[2] if a<b  and a<c here a is small.
step[3] if it is true print 'a' is the smallest number.
step[4]else b or c  is smallest number.
step[5]check b<c .
step[6]if yes then print b is smallest
step[7]else print c is smallest.


[12]how to add two numbers without using the arithmeic operator in java.



[13] write a java program to reverse a given number.

step[1] enter the number n
step[2] set reverse=0
step[3] if n>0 if yes then reverse=(reverse*10)+(n%10)
step[4]n=n/10
